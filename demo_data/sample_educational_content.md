## Mathematics - Algebra

### Quadratic Equations
A quadratic equation is a polynomial equation of degree 2. The general form is:
ax² + bx + c = 0

Where a, b, and c are constants and a ≠ 0.

**Methods to solve:**
1. Factoring
2. Quadratic formula: x = (-b ± √(b²-4ac)) / 2a
3. Completing the square

**Example:**
Solve x² - 5x + 6 = 0
Using factoring: (x-2)(x-3) = 0
Solutions: x = 2 or x = 3

## Science - Biology

### Photosynthesis
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy.

**Equation:**
6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂

**Process:**
1. Light absorption by chlorophyll
2. Water splitting (photolysis)
3. Carbon dioxide fixation
4. Glucose production

**Importance:**
- Produces oxygen for respiration
- Forms the base of most food chains
- Removes CO₂ from atmosphere
